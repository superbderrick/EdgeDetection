# EdgeDetector.

The project is simple edge detector that can detect edge part int normal raw file.

I 'm just  working on this project In order to learn Basic Multimedia knowledges  and to learn c/c++.

It has three modes that can detect the edges.

mode1 :  After read normal raw file , specify the color value to 1 and 127 to the edge depending on your threshold.

mode2 :  I am  researching a new algorithm.

mode3 :  apply sobel alogorism.



1. cd execution_file 

2.  ./ EdgeDetector - "normal raw file" ,  " width "  " height " , " Detector mode "
